I'm a designer in San Francisco, CA. I grew up in Ohio. I currently build things with the brilliant people of [GitHub](http://www.github.com).

<h4>Professionally speaking</h4>

I was a designer at [Bleacher Report](http://bleacherreport.com) and a Product Manager at [Yelp](http://yelp.com). I've done freelance work for LinkedIn, Mint, and SEOMoz. And I've helped [Ramit Sethi](http://iwillteachyoutoberich.com) and [Tim Ferriss](http://fourhourblog.com) launch their blogs and NYT best-selling books.
